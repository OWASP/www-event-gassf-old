### About San Francisco:

<p>It may measure less than 50 square miles and have a population that doesn’t even crack a million, but San Francisco justly ranks as one of the greatest cities in the world. Famous for grand-dame Victorians, cable cars, dynamic diversity, a beautiful waterfront, and a soaring crimson bridge, the “City by the Bay” truly has it all. Trend-defining cuisine ranging from Michelin-starred dining aplenty to outrageous food trucks; world-renowned symphony, ballet, theater, and opera; plus almost boundless outdoor adventures, San Francisco justifiably stands out as one of the ultimate must-visit cities on any traveler’s wish list.</p>
<p>San Francisco International Airport (SFO) offers non-stop flights to more than 50 international destinations on more than 40 international carriers. The Bay Area’s largest airport connects nonstop with 88 cities in the U.S. on 12 domestic airlines. Located just 14 miles south of the city, it is directly connected to downtown San Francisco by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). Once you’ve arrived, explore the city with San Francisco's Muni transit system, any of our tour or transportation partners, or simply on foot! Don't let our famous hills fool you; San Francisco is ranked as one of the top walking cities in the U.S.</p>

### Getting there:
